# 👟 My Sneaker Closet
This project is part of Snap Engineering Academy Stage 2. The goal was to build a simple catalog-style website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no shortcuts.

I decided to make something that’s personal to me: a catalog of sneakers from my own collection.

I’ve always had a huge passion for shoes. Growing up, I wanted sneakers I couldn’t always get — money was tight, and my parents did their best. Now that I’m older and working part-time, every pair I buy feels like a little win. I know the younger me would be smiling.

So this site isn’t just code. It’s a reminder of how far I’ve come and where I’m heading.

## 📸 About the Project

At first, I honestly didn’t know how to use arrays of objects like this.

I watched a couple YouTube videos (thank you [**Bro Code**](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez)) just to understand how to organize data in JavaScript. Once I realized each sneaker could be its own object with key-value pairs, it finally clicked.

I chose sneakers because I genuinely love them. Each pair has a story, and this catalog is my way of sharing a piece of that. Instead of copying a boring product list, I built something that actually means something to me — and I genuinely had fun with it.

- How to dynamically generate HTML with JavaScript
- How to use `.filter()` and `.sort()` together
- How to target elements in the DOM and listen for user input
- That **`innerHTML = ""`** is key for re-rendering data 😅
- That **JavaScript ≠ Java** in *any* way 😭
